## A lit bit about me
I'm 20 years old guy started programming using LUA at age of 14, then I worked as freelancer using LUA for sometime,Then I moved to several amount of languages like Java, PHP, C, C++. I'm interested more in C++, Thats why i used it in more than a project including (2D, 3D game, multiplayer games, and even softwares).
